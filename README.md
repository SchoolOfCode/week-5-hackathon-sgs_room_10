Milestones
Plan and design your database schema (You should have a minimum of 2 tables that are linked with a primary and foreign key)

Write a database initialisation script. Create a SQL script that will:

Drop any existing tables (if they exist)

Recreate all the tables based on the schema

Populate the tables with some initial seed data

Plan out your API routes and resources. Create your requirements tables similar to the one above.

Set up a basic Express server with a test route.

Implement CRUD operations using the pg package to interact with your database.

Test the API using tools like Postman or Thunder Client.
